include web-based HTTP interfaces as well as command line-based management
interfaces. In the event remote HTTP management is required, the access must be
via HTTPS.

all management access to a restricted network.</td>

6.3 to configure the management console for HTTPS.
<br><br>
This involves the following steps.
1. Create a keystore in JKS format.
2. Ensure the management console binds to HTTPS.
3. Create a new Security Realm.
4. Configure Management Interface to use new security realm.
5. Configure the management console to use the keystore.

<td>HTTPS must be enabled for JBoss web interfaces.</td>
<td>Encryption is critical for protection of remote access sessions. If encryption
is not being used for integrity, malicious users may gain the ability to modify
the application server configuration. The use of cryptography for ensuring
integrity of remote access sessions mitigates that risk.
<br><br>
Application servers
utilize a web management interface and scripted commands when allowing remote
access. Web access requires the use of TLS, and scripted access requires using
ssh or some other form of approved cryptography. Application servers must have a
capability to enable a secure remote admin capability.
<br><br>
FIPS 140-2 approved TLS
versions include TLS V1.0 or greater.
<br><br>
FIPS 140-2 approved TLS versions must be
enabled, and non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled.

used. SSL has known security vulnerabilities, so TLS should be used instead.

disclosure. The disclosure may reveal user identifier/password combinations,
website code revealing business logic, or other user personal information.
